## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Add items to the cart and remove them
- Increase/decrease the number of items in the cart
- See an order confirmation modal when they click "Confirm Order"
- Reset their selections when they click "Start New Order"
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

### Continued development

- To be able to fully understand the utilize the use of useContext hook when the situation requires it. The useContext hook allows for global access of functions throughout a react application when the components are encapsulated within the context provider component of a useContext hook.


### Useful resources

- [Creating a shopping cart using react.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lATafp15HWA) - This tutorial was able to help me understand the use of the react hook useContext and how it should be used to manage the state of a shopping cart.
